# Creating the IDL file

The created IDL file is located in the following folder:

*<MCUXpressoSDK\_install\_dir\>/boards/evkmimxrt1170/multicore\_examples/erpc\_common/erpc\_matrix\_multiply/service/erpc\_matrix\_multiply.erpc*

The created IDL file contains the following code:

```
program erpc_matrix_multiply
/*! This const defines the matrix size. The value has to be the same as the
Matrix array dimension. Do not forget to re-generate the erpc code once the
matrix size is changed in the erpc file */
const int32 matrix_size = 5;
/*! This is the matrix array type. The dimension has to be the same as the
matrix size const. Do not forget to re-generate the erpc code once the
matrix size is changed in the erpc file */
type Matrix = int32[matrix_size][matrix_size];
interface MatrixMultiplyService {
erpcMatrixMultiply(in Matrix matrix1, in Matrix matrix2, out Matrix result_matrix) ->
void
}
```

Details:

-   The IDL file starts with the program name \(*erpc\_matrix\_multiply*\), and this program name is used in the naming of all generated outputs.
-   The declaration and definition of the constant variable named *matrix\_size* follows next. The *matrix\_size* variable is used for passing information about the length of matrix dimensions to the client/server user code.
-   The alias name for the two-dimensional array type \(*Matrix*\) is declared.
-   The interface group *MatrixMultiplyService* is located at the end of the IDL file. This interface group contains only one function declaration *erpcMatrixMultiply*.
-   As shown above, the functionâ€™s declaration contains three parameters of Matrix type: *matrix1* and *matrix2* are input parameters, while *result\_matrix* is the output parameter. Additionally, the returned data type is declared as void.

When writing the IDL file, the following order of items is recommended:

1.  Program name at the top of the IDL file.
2.  New data types and constants declarations.
3.  Declarations of interfaces and functions at the end of the IDL file.
