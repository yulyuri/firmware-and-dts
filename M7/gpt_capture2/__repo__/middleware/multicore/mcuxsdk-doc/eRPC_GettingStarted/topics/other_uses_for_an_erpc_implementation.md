# Other uses for an eRPC implementation

The eRPC implementation is generic, and its use is not limited to just embedded applications. When creating an eRPC application outside the embedded world, the same principles apply. For example, this manual can be used to create an eRPC application for a PC running the Linux operating system. Based on the used type of transport medium, existing transport layers can be used, or new transport layers can be implemented.
